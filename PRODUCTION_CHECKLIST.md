# Production Readiness Checklist for `pw-agent`

## 1. Environment and Security
- Store secrets in HashiCorp Vault or similar tool
- Validate environment variables at startup with zod or joi
- Configure CORS for trusted origins only

- Send logs to Grafana Loki in production
- Add request IDs for request tracing

## 3. Scalability & Performance
- Deploy multiple instances with Kubernetes
- Use connection pooling for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Configure rate limiting based on production traffic

## 4. Database & Storage
- Add database migrations on deployment (`prisma migrate deploy`)

- Monitor database performance with profilers

## 5. Testing & Quality
- Maintain good test coverage (unit, integration, load tests)
- Automate tests in CI/CD pipelines

## 6. DevOps & Deployment
- Separate backend and frontend to different services
- Build CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Monitor with Prometheus, Grafana, and Sentry for uptime and performance


## 7. Further development points
- Batch upload support
- AI Insights 
  - pattern detection (recurring issues, trends in tests)
  - comparative analysis (across multiple test runs for the same test)
  - flaky test detection
- Custom dashboards for different stakeholders
- Integration Capabilities
  - Slack notifications for critical issues
  - JIRA/Linear integration for automatic issue creation
- Refine AI prompts based on analysis quality
- Optimize performance for large files
- Cost management optimizations (token usage for analysis)
